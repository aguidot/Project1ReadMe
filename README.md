![used_car_salesman](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85652410/129506201-ce92dedd-5ae0-4e39-8f15-cc552311e47c.jpg)


####
#### The used car market is currently experiencing an all time high with prices rising by 45% during the last 12 months. This activity in the market corresponds to threats of rising inflation and potential increase in interest rates alongside news of ongoing supply shortages in automotive electronics. Our project focused on analyzing used car sales data to navigate the best buying and selling opportunities in the current market. We examined current geographical trends across vehicle type, specifications, mileage, and units sold as well as compare changes in the economic landscape.
